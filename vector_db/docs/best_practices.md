# Vector Database Best Practices

## Implementation Guidelines

### Model Selection
- Use lightweight models (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for better performance
- Balance between embedding quality and computational cost
- Consider quantization for large-scale deployments

### Hardware Optimization
- GPU Configuration:
  - RTX 4050 (6GB VRAM) optimal settings:
    - Batch size: 32-64 for embedding generation
    - Model size: â‰¤ 1GB for efficient inference
- RAM Usage:
  - 32GB RAM considerations:
    - HNSW index: max_connections=64
    - Cache size: 25% of available RAM
    - Segment size: 1000-10000 vectors

### Search Optimization
1. Hybrid Search
   - Combine dense and sparse vectors for better recall
   - Use proper weights for vector combination
   - Consider filtering for precise results

2. Performance Tips
   - Use batch operations for uploads
   - Implement proper payload indexing
   - Set appropriate score_threshold

3. Production Deployment
   - Regular snapshots for backup
   - Monitoring query latency
   - Horizontal scaling when needed

## Benchmarking Results

| Operation | Average Latency | p95 Latency |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Vector Search (k=10) | 15ms | 25ms |
| Hybrid Search (k=10) | 25ms | 40ms |
| Batch Upload (100 vectors) | 200ms | 350ms |
