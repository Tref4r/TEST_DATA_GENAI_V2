## Performance Monitoring & Optimization
---

### Telemetry, Alerts, And Tuning Playbooks
<details>
<summary>KPIs, dashboards, and remediation flows</summary>

---

- **Key performance indicators**
  - Latency, throughput, task quality, safety, and drift indicators.

- **Dashboards**
  - Time-series views with cohorts by adapter and version; drill-down by dataset slice.

- **Optimization levers**
  - Quantization, dynamic batching, KV-cache management, prompt compression.

- **Runbooks**
  - Latency spike, quality regression, safety violation, cost overrun.

---

</details>

### Metrics & SLOs
<details>
<summary>Targets, budgets, and release gates</summary>

---

- **Latency & availability**
  - Targets: `p50 < 400ms`, `p95 < 1200ms`, availability `>= 99.9%` (configurable per product).
  - Windows: rolling `7d` for SLO, alerting on `5m` sustained breach.
- **Quality & safety**
  - Primary: task metric (e.g., Exact-Match/F1 or business “good-response-rate”).
  - Safety: violation rate `< 0.1%`; auto-rollback if exceeded for `> 5m`.
- **Cost**
  - Track `$ / 1k tokens (train/infer)`, GPU utilization, and cache hit-rate; alert on budget burn `> 120%` of weekly plan.
- **Release gates**
  - Canary advances only if: `p95` within target, error rate below threshold, safety violations below target, and cost within plan.
- **Traceability**
  - Every deploy emits a **release marker** and version tag for correlation across dashboards and logs.

### Logging & Tracing Schema
<details>
<summary>Fields for observability and root-cause analysis</summary>

---

- **Log/trace schema**
  - Table
    | **Field** | **Description** |
    |---|---|
    | **trace_id** | Correlates request across services |
    | **span_id** | Sub-operation within a trace |
    | **model_id / adapter_id / version** | Exact model + adapter + semantic version |
    | **route** | API route / feature |
    | **input_len / output_len** | Tokens in/out |
    | **latency_ms** | End-to-end time |
    | **cache_hit** | KV/prompt cache hit flag |
    | **safety_flags** | PII/Toxic/Hate/etc. booleans |
    | **cost_usd** | Monetized per-request cost |
    | **user_hash** | Stable hashed user id for cohorting |
- **Sampling**
  - Head-based sampling `1–10%` for full payload traces; error/safety outliers upsampled `→ 100%`.
- **PII**
  - Redact/ tokenize before persistence; keep raw only in volatile memory for filtering.

---

</details>

### Cost & Capacity Monitoring
<details>
<summary>Metrics to keep spend predictable and throughput stable</summary>

---

- **Key cost metrics**
  - `$ / 1k tokens (infer/train)`, GPU `utilization`, `tokens/sec`, `queue_depth`, `batch_fill_rate`.
- **Python exporter (Prometheus)**
  - Example
    ```python
    from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, start_http_server
    infer_tokens = Counter("infer_tokens_total", "Output tokens", ["model","adapter","route"])
    infer_cost = Counter("infer_cost_usd_total", "Inference cost (USD)", ["model","adapter","route"])
    latency = Histogram("infer_latency_ms", "End-to-end latency (ms)", buckets=[100,200,400,800,1200,2000,5000])

    if __name__ == "__main__":
      start_http_server(9108)  # scrape target
      # within request handler:
      # infer_tokens.labels(model, adapter, route).inc(out_tokens)
      # infer_cost.labels(model, adapter, route).inc(cost_usd)
      # latency.observe(ms)
    ```
- **Budget math (tie to Part 2)**
  - Embed weekly budget; alert when projected run-rate `> 120%` of plan; surface per-feature spend for prioritization.

---

</details>

### Online Evaluation, Drift & Shadow
<details>
<summary>Shadow eval, data drift detection, and rollback criteria</summary>

---

- **Shadow evaluation**
  - Mirror `1–5%` of prod traffic to candidate; compute acceptance/quality gaps vs control; store per-slice stats.
- **Data drift**
  - Monitor input distributions (length, language, toxicity proxy); Population Stability Index (PSI) `> 0.2` triggers offline re-eval.
- **Rollback criteria (tie to Part 3)**
  - Auto-rollback if: `p95` or error rate breach `> 5m`, safety rate `> 0.1%`, or acceptance drops `> 3σ` from baseline.
- **Mermaid – flow**
  - Diagram
    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
      A["Prod Traffic"] --> B["Control Model"];
      A --> C["Candidate Shadow/Canary"];
      B --> D["Eval Service"];
      C --> D;
      D --> E["Metrics Store / TSDB"];
      E --> F["Alertmanager / On-call"];
    ```

## Reliability Engineering
---

### Failure Modes, Safeguards, And Recovery
<details>
<summary>Error taxonomy, guardrails, and recovery procedures</summary>

---

- **Failure modes**
  - OOM, tokenizer mismatch, adapter merge errors, API timeouts, and hot-spot shards.

- **Safeguards**
  - Health probes, autoscaling policies, circuit breakers, and rate limiting.

- **Recovery**
  - Rollback to last known good, re-queue via DLQ, snapshot/restore of model registry.

- **Auditability**
  - Trace IDs on all requests and immutable logs for compliance.

### Alert Rules (Prometheus Examples)
<details>
<summary>Latency, error rate, safety, and cost burn</summary>

---

- **Latency p95**
  - YAML
    ```yaml
    groups:
      - name: llm_alerts
        rules:
          - alert: LLMHighP95
            expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(infer_latency_ms_bucket[5m])) by (le)) > 1.2
            for: 5m
            labels: { severity: page }
            annotations:
              summary: "p95 latency breach"
              runbook: "runbooks/latency_spike.md"
    ```
- **Safety violation rate**
  - YAML
    ```yaml
    - alert: LLMSafetyViolations
      expr: rate(safety_violations_total[5m]) > 0.001
      for: 5m
      labels: { severity: page }
      annotations:
        summary: "Safety violation rate high"
        runbook: "runbooks/safety_violation.md"
    ```
- **Cost burn**
  - YAML
    ```yaml
    - alert: LLMCostOverrun
      expr: (increase(infer_cost_usd_total[1h])) > 1.2 * ($BUDGET_PER_HOUR)
      for: 30m
      labels: { severity: ticket }
      annotations:
        summary: "Projected cost overrun"
        runbook: "runbooks/cost_overrun.md"
    ```
