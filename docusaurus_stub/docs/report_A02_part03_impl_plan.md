## Implementation Plan
---

### Timeline, Milestones, And KPIs
<details>
<summary>Phased plan with acceptance criteria</summary>

---

- **Phase zero – foundations**
  - Repository setup, data contracts, CI sanity; KPI: pipeline pass `>= 95%`.

- **Phase one – PEFT MVP**
  - Train adapters and run shadow traffic; KPI: `+X%` exact match, SLA `p95 < 1200ms`.

- **Phase two – hardening**
  - Red-team tests and safety filters; KPI: policy violations `< 0.1%`.

- **Phase three – RLHF (optional)**
  - DPO/PPO iterations; KPI: A/B win rate `>= target` with stable variance.

- **Phase four – rollout**
  - Blue–green and canary releases; KPI: zero incidents across two weekly cycles.

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) & Deliverables Map
<details>
<summary>Activities, owners, and artifacts aligned to A02 deliverables</summary>

---

- **Phase 0 – Foundations**
  - Activities: repo scaffolding, secrets management, data contracts, CI smoke.
  - Artifacts: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, data schema, CI workflow YAML.
- **Phase 1 – PEFT MVP**
  - Activities: dataset curation, SFT with LoRA/QLoRA, eval harness.
  - Artifacts: adapters in registry, eval report, inference baseline.
- **Phase 2 – Hardening**
  - Activities: safety filters, jailbreak tests, rate limits, caching.
  - Artifacts: red-team report, filter rules, cache config.
- **Phase 3 – Alignment (optional)**
  - Activities: preference collection, DPO runs, alignment eval.
  - Artifacts: preference dataset, DPO checkpoints, win-rate report.
- **Phase 4 – Rollout**
  - Activities: canary/blue-green, SLO validation, runbook review.
  - Artifacts: release notes, rollback plan, on-call schedule.

- **Deliverables map (A02)**
  - Strategy comparison → Part 1 + Part 2 summaries.
  - Technical specs (quant/data/hardware) → Part 1 § Specs.
  - Implementation steps + code → Part 1 § Minimal Runnable Example; this plan.
  - Optimization & troubleshooting → Part 1/4.
  - Cost analysis → Part 2.

### Environments, Releases & Rollback
<details>
<summary>Promotion gates, canary ramps, and rollback playbook</summary>

---

- **Environment matrix**
  - Table
    | **Env** | **Purpose** | **Data** | **Traffic** | **Gate** |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Dev | iteration | synthetic/dev only | none | unit+lint |
    | Staging | pre-prod | sanitized prod slice | shadow/canary `1–5%` | offline eval pass |
    | Prod | live | full prod | ramp `5%→25%→50%→100%` | SLOs met |

- **Release procedure**
  - Build image → push → deploy **blue** alongside **green** → start canary at `5%` → step every `30–60 min` if SLO `p95` and error budgets hold.
  - Observability: latency `p50/p95`, error rate, safety violations, acceptance/CTR.

- **Rollback playbook**
  - Auto-trigger: latency `p95` or error rate breach for `>5 min`.
  - Actions: freeze traffic ramp → switch to previous stable revision → flush cache keys for new build → open incident ticket with timestamps & metrics links.
  - Post-mortem: within `24h`, include root cause, fix plan, owner.

- **Sample commands (illustrative)**
  - **Train PEFT with DeepSpeed/Accelerate**
    ```bash
    accelerate launch --config_file configs/accelerate.yaml \
      --deepspeed configs/ds_zero2.json train_sft_peft.py
    ```
  - **Promote artifact**
    ```bash
    mlflow models serve -m "models:/llm-adapter@staging" --port 8000
    ```

### Evaluation & Sign-off
<details>
<summary>Offline/online eval, safety checks, and launch criteria</summary>

---

- **Data splits**
  - `train/val/test` with domain stratification; keep test held-out.
- **Offline metrics (task-dependent)**
  - Exact-match/F1, Rouge-L, BLEU, BERTScore; long-form judge (e.g., MT-Bench style) for qualitative checks.
- **Safety & compliance**
  - Toxicity/PII filters; jailbreak suite (prompt injections, system-prompt leakage); log redactions.
- **Online A/B (if applicable)**
  - Success metrics: acceptance rate, good-response rate, escalation rate; monitor `p50/p95` latency.
  - Stats: minimum sample size; guard sequential peeking; 95% CI, power `≥ 0.8`.
- **Sign-off criteria**
  - Meets or exceeds baseline on primary offline metric and online acceptance; safety violations `<0.1%`; latency `p95 < 1200ms`.
- **Traceability**
  - Link to Part 1 (architecture/eval harness), Part 4 (monitoring dashboards), Part 2 (cost targets).

## Technical Accountability
---

### Ownership, Processes, And Success Metrics
<details>
<summary>Team responsibilities, SOPs, and definitions of success</summary>

---

- **Ownership**
  - **Model Ops**: deployment, rollback, incident response.
  - **Data Engineering**: ingest, cleaning, splitting, and lineage.

- **Processes**
  - RFC process for model changes; standardized postmortems and runbooks.

- **Success metrics**
  - CSAT, cost per token, SLA `p95`, A/B win rate, safety violation rate.

---

</details>

### RACI & Governance
<details>
<summary>Ownership matrix, change control, and on-call coverage</summary>

---

- **RACI (sample)**
  - Table
    | **Workstream** | **R** | **A** | **C** | **I** |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Data pipeline | Data Eng | Head of Data | Model Ops | Security |
    | Training runs | Model Eng | Eng Manager | Data Eng | PM |
    | Release | Model Ops | Eng Director | SRE | Support |
    | Incidents | On-call SRE | Eng Director | Model Ops | All |
- **Change control**
  - RFC template, approvers list, freeze windows, mandatory post-mortems.
- **Runbooks**
  - Paging policy, dashboards, SLOs, rollback steps, comms templates.
- **Compliance**
  - PII handling, retention, access controls, vendor reviews.
